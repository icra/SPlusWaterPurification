about=Water purification is an essential ecosystem service whereby natural ecosystems contribute to the removal of harmful substances—such as nitrogen and phosphorus—from water, thereby enhancing its quality and safety for human use and for the ecosystems themselves. This plugin delivers two Python Processing models: Landscape model(computes N & P retention and their economic value per Landscape Service Unit (LSU)) and Channel model (computes the same indicators for river/channel) segments.Outputs include `PhoshPurVal` and `NitroPurVal` layers expressing the annual economic benefit. Developed within the EU MERLIN project.
